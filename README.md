## Going to learn

### Git
 * [ ] Skipping files on pull request. For e.g. the target repo
       doesn't contain `.gitignore`, and I need it to make my life
       a bit easier: have it and avoid extra steps on ignoring its
       existence at every git action.
       How to remove this file from pull request scope?
